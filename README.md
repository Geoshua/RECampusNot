# RECampusNot
This is a continuation to the collab project Campus Not. All new addition will be of my own accord.

The original repo is at https://github.com/originallyorange/CampusNotUnnofficial, credits to originallyorange and stefandr24.

As of right now the website cannot run on its own as it was hosted by the clamV server at Constructor University and all backend code was meant for the server, changes are subject to due in some time, future plans are to test the project with a personal server.

This project involves using SQL for database interaction, PHP for backend and HTML for Front-End.
